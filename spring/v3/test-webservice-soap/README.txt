Test SOAP project based on spring WS.

I tested this project in jboss 4.2.3 (you need to put sqljdbc4-4.0.jar in server/{instanse}/lib). Link for get wsdl -  http://localhost:8080/test-webservice-soap/contract.wsdl
There is script for create table in 'test-webservice-rest\src\main\resources\sql'.

There is test request to web service in requestExample.xml
