Test REST project based on spring mvc.

I tested this is project in jboss 4.2.3. Link for testing -  http://localhost:8080/test-webservice-rest/
I used mysql database. So you need to create database and table(there's script in 'test-webservice-rest\src\main\resources\sql').
You can set propersties for database connection in file that placed in 'test-webservice-rest\src\main\resources\properties'
